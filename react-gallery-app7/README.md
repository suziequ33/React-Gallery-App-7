- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I first got hung up on Vite. We didnt really look into it so much and didnt relize that just need to delete and change the components. 
I also had truble with fetch from Flickr, with the search page I went back to Unit 5/working with Fetch API.
Didnt relize that I need to add the root file to index.html/ added that but also added index.css and index.jsx.
I say and example of the URL in the img tag and found it worked to i took out the const in the Photo.jsx component. I thought that was very cool./mdn web docs.
